== requirements ==

   + PHP >=4.3

== installation ==
	
	1.  Upload to your plugins folder, usually
	    `wp-content/plugins/`, keeping the directory structure intact
	    (i.e. `wp-forecast.php` should end up in
	    `wp-content/plugins/wp-forecast/`).

	2.  Activate the plugin on the plugin screen.

	3.  Visit the configuration page (Options -> WP-forecast) to
            pick the number of widgets, data to display and to change 
	    any other option.

	4a. Visit the Themes/Widgets page to place your wp-forecat 
	    widget within your themes sidebars

	and/or
	   
	4b. Edit your template file and put the wp-forecast function
            where you want your weather data to show up. 
	    Example:
	   
	    <ul>
	     <li>
	       <?php if(function_exists(wp_forecast)) { 
	                wp_forecast( <widget_id> ); 
		} ?>
	     </li>
	    </ul>
 
	    You have to replace <widget_id> with the choosen widget id.
	    For the first widget use wp_firecast("A"), for the second 
	    wp_forecast("B") and so on.

            In some cases you must put the call into a div environment.

	5.  Optional
	    If you would like to have another set of icons download it
	    from http://accunet.accuweather.com/wx/accunet/graphics_icons.htm 
	    and put it into the wp-content/plugins/wp-forecast/icons folder

        6.  Optional
	    If you would like to change the style, just edit wp-forecast.css
	    there are three classes div.wp-forecast for outer formatting, 
	    table.wp-forecast for the middle part or iconpart and 
	    wp-forecast-details for everything below the icon


== translations ==

   wp-forecast comes with various translations, located in the directory lang.
   if you would like to add a new translation, just take the file
   wp-forecast.pot (in the wp-forecast main directory) copy it to
   <iso-code>.po and edit it to add your translations (e.g. with poedit).


   there are different translations for the german language using
   different charsets. the defaukt de_DE uses UTF-8, de_DE-iso-8859-1
   uses iso-8859-1 and de_DE-latin1 uses HTML entitites.


   to use a different as the defalult just rename the appropriate file
   to de_DE.po and de_DE.mo
